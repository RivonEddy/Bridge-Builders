Topic: Higher Level Living.

NOTE
Higher Level Living" means you are living by the word, i.e, training yourself to live according to God's word. Matt 4:4; Luke 4:4.
When you live by God's word, you are on the higher way. If nothing can stop God's word from coming to pass, it means nothing can stop you from where you want to get to. When you believe, you are what God says you are, you are living the higher level life.
