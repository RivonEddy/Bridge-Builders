Topic: Communication, God's Way.

NOTE
When you have the mind of God, you can speak boldy. When you have a bad communication, it will only take God to remove it out of your mind. When you take in bad comunication, that is what will form you, it is also as the good communication. When you take in the word of God, he will communicate with you. When you take the word into your spirit, your spirit will become a giant.
