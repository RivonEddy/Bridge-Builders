Topic: Strong Reasons And Contrite Heart.

NOTE
A contrite heart is a heart that is genuine. When your heart is always genuine, God does not despise you. A heart that is not genuine i.e carefree will have difficulties in convincing God. It is only a contrite heart that can convince God genuinely, it always gets God attention. A contrite heart always gets God's notice.
